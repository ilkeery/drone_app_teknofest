# It's an older version of the drone app that i coded for #TEKNOFEST.
I have lost the last version of it, so it needs lots of optimazation.
But i believe it will be very useful for people. 
1. Connect firebase to repo not all pages.
2. Use getter setter to reach the data.
3. ...

This app has:
1- Flutter Map with NO Google API totally free map that using openstreetmap
2- Firebase connection
3- 3DModel and lots of other things..
